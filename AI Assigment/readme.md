# **AI Projects**

This repository contains the implementation of two tasks for an AI assignment provided by **Vijayi WFH Technologies Pvt Ltd**. The assignment consists of two main parts:

- **Task 1**: Machine Learning Pipeline for Classifying Customer Support Tickets
- **Task 2**: RAG-Based Semantic Quote Retrieval and Structured QA with Model Training

## **Task 1: Machine Learning Pipeline for Customer Support Tickets**

This task involves building a machine learning pipeline to classify customer support tickets based on their issue type and urgency level, as well as extract key entities like product names and complaint keywords. The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, multi-task learning, and entity extraction. 

### **Key Features**:
- Classification of tickets by issue type and urgency level.
- Extraction of key entities from ticket text.
- Optionally, a Gradio app for real-time interaction.

## **Task 2: RAG-Based Semantic Quote Retrieval**

This task involves building a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for semantic quote retrieval and structured question answering. The solution includes fine-tuning a sentence embedding model, building a RAG pipeline, and deploying a **Streamlit** app for interactive querying.

### **Key Features**:
- Fine-tuned sentence embedding model for semantic quote retrieval.
- Implementation of the RAG pipeline.
- Evaluation using frameworks like **RAGAS**.
- Interactive **Streamlit** application for querying quotes.
