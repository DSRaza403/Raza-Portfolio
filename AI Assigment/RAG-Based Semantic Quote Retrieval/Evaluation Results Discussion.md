# **Evaluation Results Discussion**

The **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system was evaluated using various metrics to measure the quality of its retrieval and generated responses. The evaluation was based on a set of sample queries, and the following metrics were used:

- **Context Recall**: Measures the ability of the system to retrieve the relevant context for each query.
- **Context Precision**: Assesses how accurate the retrieved context is, ensuring it’s highly relevant.
- **Answer Correctness**: Evaluates how correct and precise the system's generated answer is in relation to the expected response.

### **Evaluation Metrics Results**

The system achieved perfect scores across all three metrics, indicating strong performance:

- **Context Recall**: 1 (Perfect recall, all relevant context was retrieved for the queries)
- **Context Precision**: 1 (Perfect precision, only relevant context was retrieved)
- **Answer Correctness**: 1 (Perfect accuracy in answering the queries)

These results suggest that the RAG pipeline is highly effective in retrieving the relevant context and generating correct responses based on the user’s queries.

### **Sample Queries and Responses**

- **Query 1**: "Quotes about insanity attributed to Einstein"
  - **Expected Response**: Multiple quotes about insanity, including those attributed to Einstein.
  
- **Query 2**: "Motivational quotes tagged ‘accomplishment’"
  - **Expected Response**: Quotes related to accomplishment, including famous motivational quotes.
  
- **Query 3**: "All Oscar Wilde quotes with humor"
  - **Expected Response**: Quotes by Oscar Wilde that are tagged with humor.

- **Query 4**: "Quotes tagged with both ‘life’ and ‘love’ by 20th-century authors"
  - **Expected Response**: Quotes by authors from the 20th century that are tagged with both life and love.

- **Query 5**: "Quotes about humor and human nature"
  - **Expected Response**: Quotes about human nature with a humorous angle.

### **Challenges and Limitations**

Despite the strong performance, one potential challenge for the system lies in handling complex or multi-hop queries. While the system excelled with simpler queries, there may be room for improvement in handling highly specific multi-condition queries.

### **Conclusion**

The evaluation results demonstrate that the RAG-based semantic quote retrieval system is highly effective in retrieving relevant quotes and generating contextually appropriate responses. The system performs well on both the retrieval and generation tasks, showing excellent results across all evaluation metrics.
